# HYAH - Your Favorite Places

HYAH is an Android application that allows users to save their favorite places with a title, image, and description. The application uses bottom navigation and has three main windows: a map window, a list of locations, and a user profile. Users can view markers of their saved locations on a map, view and edit a list of their saved locations, and view and edit their own profile. Data is stored in a JSON file.

4. You can then run the application on an emulator or an Android device.

## Usage
- Use the bottom navigation to switch between the map, list, and profile windows.
